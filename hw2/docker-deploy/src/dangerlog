danger log:
Current bugs: Does not support GET chunked data. When we are trying to use Daemon, we cannot write to the file, possibily due to permission issue.
              We did not include all the cache-control. Missed ones: max-stale, min-fresh, no-transform, only-if-cached, stale-if-error and immutable

Fixed issue: When using CONNECT method, we did not consider the header ends with \r\n. Fixed the parsing issue.
             When resending the validation info, we originally sent the header of the respond header, instead of request header.
             When building the Daemon, we did not close the parent process. Fixed the bug so that the children/Daemon can be detached from the parent process
